Demonstration of gmxapi
=======================
In this repository, we demonstrate a workflow of launching a standard MD simulation, an expanded ensemble simulation or an 1D alchemical metadynamics simulation. We also include the example designed in [gmxapi-tutorials](https://github.com/kassonlab/gmxapi-tutorials) provided by the Kasson lab.
