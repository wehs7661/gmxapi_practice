    "In this notebook, we want to see if we can use `gmxapi` to launch one or more expanded ensemble simulations with MPI-enabled GROMACS on Bridges-2. With the same input file `sys.tpr`, below I demonstrate 3 cases of running expanded ensemble simulations and show the corresponding issues I have with them. In each folder `case_*`, there is a Python script `case_*.py` and a common `tpr` file `sys.tpr` for starting the simulation. The cells in this notebook are all executed in an interactive node with 128 cores on Bridges-2. Necessary modules and virtual environment have been activated before the notebook was launched. "

However, in this case, when we are using `gmxapi` 0.2.3 with MPI-enabled GROMACS, there is no such a folder and the outputs of the command are saved as the same working directory where the command got executed. I'm wondering the reason for this. Does this come from different versions of `gmxapi` or thread-MPI v.s. MPI?\n",
    "- Also, with `gmxapi 0.3.0` and thread-MPI GROMACS, the object created by `gmx.commandline_opeartion` has attributes like `stderr` and `stdout` so that the user can print STDERR and STDOUT by printing `stderr.result()` and `stdout.result()`. However, in our case here in the notebook, I found that the object `md` does not have such attributes and I could only print out the return code. I'm wondering how I can print out `STDOUT` and `STDERR` in my case here? Are they only available in version `0.3.0`?\n",

    "As shown above, a call to the `fork()` system called was still involved. This time, 16 folders corresponding to the 16 simulations were created but they are still not in the form of `mdrun_*_i*_*`. Importantly, this time at least the first simulation (index 0) got executed by `gmx.mdrun` successfully, but the process then ended without running all the other 15 simulations. No simulations hung without crashing as we've seen in case 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding this case, I have the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the reason that only one simulation got executed? Using `gmxapi` 0.3.0 with thread-MPI GROMACS, I was able to use a script like `case_3.py` with `mpiexec` to run multiple simulations simultaneously without any problems. \n",
    "- When only running a single simulation, we can use the following script to modify parameters by reading the `tpr` file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "simulation_input = gmx.read_tpr('sys.tpr')\n",
    "modified_input = gmx.modify_input(input=simulation_input, parameters={'nsteps': 1000})\n",
    "md = gmx.mdrun(input=modified_input)\n",
    "md = gmx.mdrun(simulation_input)\n",
    "md.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, what if we need to change parameters for each of the 16 simulations such that each simulation has a different value for one or more parameters? I'm asking this because our first staged goal is to run an ensemble of expanded ensemble simulations, where we might need to constantly restart or extend the simulations with updated weights. The execution of the ensemble should be as simple as launching a single command like `mpirun -np 16 python -m mpi4py ensemble_EE.py`, where the algorithm about how the weights should be changed or how the simulations interact with each other are specified in `ensemble_EE.py`. I know that it is possible to write a customized Python script to parse the `mdp` file and generate an updated `tpr` file by `grompp` using `gmx.commandline_operation`. However, running `grompp` only requires 1 process (`-np 1`), which means that we can't update the `tpr` file in `ensemble_EE.py` that is always executed with 16 processes. I guess it's not entirely clear to me how we can automate the adjustment of MD parameters for an ensemble of simulations using `gmxapi` in a single script like `ensemble_EE.py`."
